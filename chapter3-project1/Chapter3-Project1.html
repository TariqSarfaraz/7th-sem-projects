Located amidst imposing mountains in Karnataka with a perpetually misty landscape, Coorg is the place to be for all nature lovers.  This popular coffee producing hill station is not only popular for its beautiful green hills and the streams cutting right through them. It also stands as a popular destination because of its culture and people. The Kodavas, a local clan specialising in martial arts, are especially notable for their keen hospitality.

              <p>Coorg, famous for its Homestays and Resorts, can be visited over a weekend. Sightseeing such as Raja's Seat. Raja's Seat is super crowded and the serenity of the place is lost in the midst of noise.</p>
